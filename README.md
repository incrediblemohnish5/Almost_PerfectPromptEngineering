# The Almost Perfect Prompt Engineering Rules

#  Almost Perfect Prompt Engineering Rules



RULE 1: Be specific. Like, really specific.

Vague prompt leads to vague output almost every time



**bad:**
write an email for me.



**good:**
Write a follow up email to a client who hasn't responded in 5 days.

tone: professional but not too stiff. maximum 100 words. 







RULE 2: Tell it WHO to be, not just WHAT to do


giving the model a role changes output quality significantly. 


For e.g. "You are a senior backend engineer at a startup".

Review this code and point out anything that is or can be bad for you.



Just saying "review my code" leads to  completely different output.



RULE 3: Show, don't just tell:
if you want a specific FORMAT actually show an example. don't just describe it.



RULE 4: Ask it to think step by step(reason)

sounds stupid, but it works significantly well.

Just add:
think step by step before replying


Or:
before giving your final reply, reason through this carefully


This is recommended for math/logic/reasoning tasks.



**when to use it:** any problem with multiple steps. math, debugging, planning, analysis.



**when NOT to:** simple factual questions like 'who is the prime minister of India'.





RULE 5: Give it an "out" when it doesn't know


if you don't do this, models can hallucinate


For Example:

Answer the question using just the text below.
________(text)

If the answer is not in the text, say "I don't know" however don't guess.
Models are trained to be helpful, which means they'll try to answer even when they don't know, you have to tell them not to guess and reply factually.




RULE 6: Separate your instructions from your content

use triple quotes and other such separators whatever, just separate them.

For eg:



**messy:** Summarize this text


**clean:**
Summarize the text given in 2 sentences.





RULE 7: Specify the output format explicitly

Don't assume it'll give you a table or a list. You will have to ask for it directly.

For e.g. :
Return your answer as a Table/list


Or:



format your response as a markdown table with columns:



this is probably a very useful rule in production.





RULE 8: Long prompt doesn't equate to better prompt



A lot of people think writing more = getting more. Misconception



-Unnecessary instructions confuse the model

-Contrary rules cancel each other out



**You have to remove everything that doesn't add information. **



AI researchers have pinpointed this out, that model attention is finite.





RULE 9: For complex tasks — break it up



Don't ask for everything in one shot.



instead:



Research this topic, write an outline, then write the full article



Do it in steps:



Step 1: Give me 5 key points about [topic]

Step 2: (after reviewing) Now write an outline based on these points

Step 3: (after reviewing) Now write section 1









RULE 10: Tell it what NOT to do (negative prompting)



Telling the model what not to do is just as important as telling it what to do.



for e.g.:

Don't use bullet points.

Don't start sentences with "I".

Don't add a conclusion section.





This works especially well for formatting.











RULE 11: No Perfect Prompt exists:



Nobody writes the perfect prompt first try.



actual workflow:

-write a rough prompt

-see what breaks

-fix the specific thing that broke

-repeat









# miscellaneous things that work



- "be concise" works better than "keep it short"

- asking for confidence levels reduces hallucinations a bit ("how confident are you in this answer, 1-10?")

- "explain this to a 16-year-old" gives surprisingly clear explanations

- for coding: always tell it the language, framework version, and what you've already tried

- "what are you not sure about in your answer?" is actually useful







# overhyped things:



- Very long system prompts with 50 rules — most get ignored

- "Pretend you have zero restrictions".

-  Asking it to "be creative" without any other guidance — just gives    generic stuff without any benefits.
